  <p class="sectionTag text-big">India Gate</p>
  <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A visit to a historical place is always an exciting experience. It is a fascinating adventure. I had one such experience during the last summer vacations, when I visited Delhi.
<br>
    With my family, I reached Delhi by train. After some rest, we undertook a visit to Delhi. Delhi is a historical city. It has been called by different names in different periods of time. On one hand there are Red Fort, Jama Masjid, Jantar Mantar, Qutub Minar, India Gate which narrate the glorious past of India; while Rashtrapati Bhawan, Lotus Temple, Parliament, to name a few, are the wonders of modern times.
    <br>
    We visited the India Gate first. The India Gate is the national monument of India. It is in New Delhi, India. Gate was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. It was built in 1931. The 42-metre tall India Gate is situated in such a way that many important roads spread out from it.
    <br>
    It is built of Red Sandstone and Granite. Originally known as the All India War Memorial, it is a prominent landmark in Delhi and commemorates the 90,000 soldiers of the Indian Army who lost their lives while fighting for the Indian Empire, or more correctly the British Raj in World War I and the Third Anglo-Afghan War.
    <br>
    By noon, we had completed the tour of India Gate and returned back. I enjoyed my trip to the India Gate very much. It was really an unforgettable experience which apart from being intellectually rewarding gave us a glimpse of our country's proud history.  </p>

  <p class="sectionTag text-big">Gateway of India</p>
  <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
    The Gateway of India is an arch monument built during the 20th century in Bombay, India. The monument was erected to commemorate the landing of King George V and Queen Mary at Apollo Bunder on their visit to India in 1911.
    <br>
    Built in Indo-Saracenic style, the foundation stone for the Gateway of India was laid on 31 March 1911. The structure is an arch made of basalt, 26 metres (85 feet) high. The final design of George Wittet was sanctioned in 1914 and the construction of the monument was completed in 1924. The Gateway was later used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for Viceroys and the new Governors of Bombay.  It served to allow entry and access to India.
    <br>
    The Gateway of India is located on the waterfront at Apollo Bunder area at the end of Chhatrapati Shivaji Marg in South Mumbai and overlooks the Arabian Sea. The monument has also been referred to as the Taj Mahal of Mumbai, and is the city’s top tourist attraction.</p>

  <p class="sectionTag text-big">Golghar</p>
  <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">None would ever had the thought of an under construction giant granary to evolve as a monument of symbolic imminence and importance back in 1780s.
<br>
    To curb out the devastating famine of 1770, this giant dome shaped (stupa shaped) granary was built, irrespective of the thought of projecting it as a symbol of importance and identity.
    <br>
    This Golghar has gradually transformed into the symbolic structure for Patna and holds a great importance in the itinerary of the sightseeing in Bihar as well.
    <br>
    This 29 meter high architectural marvel, with the diameter of around 125 meters has no pillars from inside and is able to hold 140000 tons of grains with a wall thickness of 3.6 meters at the base. The Golghar has a 145 step spiral staircase around the building through which one can go on to the top of the structure. The stairs were designed in such a way to facilitate the passage of the workers who loaded and unloaded the grain is the granary, who had to carry grain-bags up one flight, deliver their load through a hole at the top, and descend the other stairs. From the top, one can witness the beautiful panoramic of the holy Ganges and the city of Patna, obviously.
    <br>
    As a part of beautification and modernization, the Golghar premises has been developed with greenery and ample seating arrangement along with some entertainment facilities as well which includes newly started Laser Show in the premises itself.</p>

  <p class="sectionTag text-big">Qutub Minar</p>
  <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
    Qutub Minar is located in the south Delhi at Aurobindo Marg, Mehrauli. It is a most famous magnificent structure made up of red sandstones called Qutb Minar. It is the second tallest tower of India stand alone as it is from the ancient time more than 800 years. The manufacturing of this tower was started in 1192 by the Qutab-ud-din Aibak (known as the first successful Muslim ruler who built this Islamic dynasty in India). It is believed as this tower was ordered to be built as the famous historic monument of India after defeating the Rajputs. The manufacturing of this tower was completed by one of his successors named Iltutmish.<br>
    It is the splendid piece of Mughal architecture and has become a popular tourist spot in India. It attracts millions of tourists especially students every year. It has been declared as one of the World Heritage Sites by the UNESCO. In the ancient time Qutub-ud-din Aibak came to India, fought to Rajputs and became successful to defeat them. In order to celebrate his victory over the Rajputs, he ordered to build this unique piece of minar. The construction of it was completed in several centuries however some changes are made from time to time (last change was done by the Sikandar Lodi). Originally it was built of only one storey tall and other storeys were added by the later rulers.
    <br>
     The base diameter of it is 14.32 metre and top diameter is 2.7 meter. It is 73 metre tall minar containing 379 steps or staircases. It is considered that it was of seven storeys however top two were fell in the earthquake. Some other unique structures such as Alai-Darwaza, Tomb of Iltutmish, two mosques, etc are surrounding this tower as well as enhancing its attraction.

  <p class="sectionTag text-big">Hawa Mahal</p>
  <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Hawa Mahal is on one side of the courtyard in the Palace, the three other sides having their own wings of the palace. The inner side of the structure is relatively plain. The exterior of the structure which is visible from the road is actually the rear side of the palace. It resembles a honeycomb structure for all the little lattice-worked windows, 953 to be precise. These windows or the jharokhas were meant to for the ladies of the royal family to be able to view the daily life on the road or processions that passed by without being seen, This was the time when women had to follow the purdah system, by keeping their faces covered in front of strangers.
<br>
    Each of this jharokha is a very fine piece of masonry, a combination of Rajput and Moghul style of architecture, the Rajput style reflected in the dome and the floral patterns and the Moghul style in the fine latticework. Each jharokha is covered with a small dome like structure. A common person can sit in these windows and imagine what luxury it must have been for the royal ladies.
    <br>
    The structure is five stories tall and the windows allow the breeze to pass through thus producing a cooling effect. This is enhanced by small fountains in each of the chambers. Maharaja Jai Singh used it as his favourite resort.
    <br>
    The entire structure of the Hawa Mahal is made of red and pink sandstone, a signature feature in Rajput architecture. This is for it to match with the other similar structures in Rajasthan and particularly Jaipur giving it the epithet of being the Pink City.</p>
